##### Declaration: 
Most of the images has been taken from the you tube videos, and at the bottom of the page I have cited the Channels from which these pictures has been taken and all the concepts explained over here are purely bases on my understanding only.

#### JavaScript Execution :
* JavsScript is executed in a Single-threaded Synchrous manner, and the Execution Context is the place in which the JavaScript gets executed.
* It has two areas 1. Memory Area (Variable Enviornment), 2. Code Area (Thread of Execution)
* 1. Memory Area (Variable Enviornment): Is responssible to store the variables and the functions in key-value pairs.
* 2. Code Area (Thread of Execution): Is responssible to execute the javascript code line by line.
